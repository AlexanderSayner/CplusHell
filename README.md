First of all, install MC Visual Studio Community 2019 for Unreal Engine. Then open the solution on directory root. Starting debug splution initialise opening Unreal Engine 4 editor.
Or just open solution and Unreal Engine project in the same time, then in Visual Studion go 
Debug -> Attach to Process... -> start filter with "edit" -> attach unreal engine editor
Then VS should start debug process.
